## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, safeguarding your online activities is more important than ever. As many of us use Docker to deploy and manage applications efficiently, ensuring their security becomes crucial. VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, offer a robust solution to this challenge by protecting your services from unauthorized access and keeping your data private.

This guide will show you how to create a Docker Compose script that places each service securely behind a VPN. Whether you're handling a small project or a large-scale application, integrating a VPN with Docker Compose can enhance your security significantly. We'll start with the basics of Docker Compose and VPNs, then provide step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring your environment. By the end of this guide, you'll have a secure setup where your Docker services are safely behind a VPN, keeping your data and applications protected from potential threats.

While it is not necessary, it is recommended to have at least a basic grasp of how Docker works before reading through this article. If you would like to learn more about Docker, [the official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) is a great resource.

## Overview of Docker Compose and VPNs

### What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool that simplifies the deployment of multi-container Docker applications. By defining services, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file, Docker Compose streamlines the management of containerized applications. This approach allows developers to easily configure and launch complex applications with just a few commands.

### Benefits of Docker Compose
* Simplifies multi-container deployments
* Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments
* Streamlines application scaling and maintenance

## Typical Use Cases
* Microservices architecture
* Development environments
* Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

### Why Use a VPN with Docker Services?
Integrating a VPN with you Docker services enhances both security and privacy. A VPN encrypts your network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and protecting sensitive data. This is especially important when your Docker services interact with external networks or handle confidential information.

### Common Scenarios and Benefits:

* Securing communications between distributed services
* Protecting data in transit from eavesdropping
* Ensuring privacy for services that need to access external resources

{{< image src="images/blog/secure-services-docker-compose-and-nordvpn/secureNetworkCommunication.png" caption="Using a VPN allows for more secure communication across your Docker services." alt="secure-communication-across-your-network" height="400" width="400" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title"  webp="false" >}}

### Understanding the Challenge
Configuring networking and container isolation in Docker can be challenging. By default, Docker containers share the host's network stack, which can lead to potential security risks. Isolating each service behind a VPN helps to mitigate those risks.

### Issues with Networking and Container Isolation
* Potential exposure of sensitive data
* Difficulty in managing network policies
* Ensuring consistent VPN connections for all services

By understanding these challenges and implementing a VPN within your Docker Compose setup, you can create a more secure and reliable environment for your applications.

## Setting Up Docker Compose

### Installing Docker and Docker Compose

#### Steps to Install Docker:

1. ##### Update Your Package Database:
  Ensure your system's package database is up-to-date

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

2. ##### Install Prerequisite Packages
  Install packages that allow apt to use repositories over HTTPS

  ```bash
  sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
  ```

3. ##### Add Docker's Official GPG Key:
  Add Docker's GPG key to verify the integrity of the software.

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  ```

4. ##### Add Docker Repository:
  Add Docker's official repository to your sources list.

  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
  ```

5. ##### Install Docker:
  Update the package database again and install Docker.

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker-ce
  ```
6. ##### Verify Docker Installation:
  Confirm Docker is installed correctly by running:

  ```bash

  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  ```

3. ##### Verify Docker Compose Installation:
  Check the version to ensure Docker Compose is installed.

  ```bash
  docker-compose --version
  ```

#### Creating a Docker Compose File

##### Basic Structure of a `docker-compose.yml` File:

A `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services, network, and volumes used in your application. Here is the basice structure:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  # Define your services here
networks:
  # Define custom networks if needed
volumes:
  # Define named volumes if needed
```

##### Explanation of Key Directives:
* **version:** Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.

* **services:** Defines the containers to be run as the part of the application.
  * **image:** Specifies the Docker image to use.
  * **build:** Allows specifying a build context and Dockerfile.
  * **ports:** Maps container ports to host ports.
  * **volumes:** Mounts host paths or named volumes.
  * **networks:** Connects services to specific networks.
* **networks:** Customized networking configurations for services.
* **volumes:** Manages data persistence using named volumes.

##### Example: Basic Docker Compose File

Here's a simple example with two services: a web server and a database.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - webnet

  database:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: exampleuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: examplepass
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - webnet

networks:
  webnet:

volumes:
  db-data:
```

By following these steps and understanding the basic structure, you can create a Docker Compose file that sets up and manages your services efficiently.

## Configuring Each Service to Use the VPN

### Choosing a VPN Provider

When selecting a VPN provider for your Docker setup, it's esential to consider several key factors to ensure optimal performance and security.

#### Setting Up the VPN Container

##### Pulling a VPN Container Image (e.g., OpenVPN):

To set up a VPN container, you will first need to pull the appropriate image from Docker Hub. Here's how you can do it using OpenVPN:

```bash
docker pull kylemanna/openvpn
```

##### Configuring the VPN Container:

1. **Initialize the OpenVPN Configuration:**
  Create a directory to store the OpenVPN configuration and initialize it.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /path/to/your/config
  docker run -v /path/to/your/config:/etc/openvpn kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://YOUR_VPN_SERVER
  ```
2. **Generate the Certificates:**
  Generate the necessary certificate and keys.

  ```bash
  docker run -v /path/to/your/config:/etc/openvpn -it kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_initpki
  ```
3. **Start the OpenVPN Container:**
  Start the container with the generated configuration.
  
  ```bash
  docker run -v /path/to/your/config:/etc/openvpn -d -p 1194:1194/udp --cap-add=NET_ADMIN kylemanna/openvpn
  ```

##### Modifying the Docker Compose File

###### Adding the VPN Container to the `docker-compose.yml` File:

To integrate the VPN container into your Docker Compose setup, you need to modify your `docker-compose.yml` file to include the VPN container and configure your services to use it.

###### Configuring Services to Route Traffic Through the VPN:

Ensure that your services are configured to route their traffic through the VPN container. This can typically be done by setting the network mode of the service to the VPN container

###### Example: Updated Docker Compose File with VPN:

Here's a step-by-step example:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  vpn:
    image: kylemanna/openvpn
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "1194:1194/udp"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/config:/etc/openvpn
    environment:
      - OPENVPN_PROVIDER=YourProvider
      - OPENVPN_CONFIG=YourConfig
    networks:
      - vpn_net

  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    depends_on:
      - vpn
    network_mode: service:vpn
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./web:/usr/share/nginx/html
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=yourdomain.com

  database:
    image: postgres:latest
    depends_on:
      - vpn
    network_mode: service:vpn
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: exampleuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: examplepass
      POSTGRES_DB: exampledb
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

networks:
  vpn_net:

volumes:
  db-data:
```

In this example:

* The `vpn` service sets up the VPN using the OpenVPN image.
* The `web` and `database` services are configured to use the VPN container's network by setting `network_mode` to `service:vpn`.
* This configuration ensures that all traffic from the `web` and `database` services is routed through the VPN, providing an added layer of security.

By following these steps and examples, you can successfully configure your Docker services to operate securely behind a VPN, enhancing both privacy and security for your applications.

## Testing and Troubleshooting

### Testing the Setup

#### Verifying the VPN Connection:

To ensure that the VPN connection is functioning correctly, you can perform a few checks:

1. **Check the VPN Container Logs:**

Inspect the logs of the VPN container to confirm it has started correctly and is connected.

```bash
docker logs <vpn-container-name>
```

2. **Test the VPN Connection:**

Use `curl` or `wget` from within a containe using the VPN to check the external IP address. The external IP address should be different than your local IP, and it should match the VPN server's IP.

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> curl ifconfig.me
```

#### Ensuring Services are Behind the VPN:

To verify that the Dockers services you created route all their web traffic through the VPN, you can access the services and check their outgoing IP addresses.

1. **Check Service IP:**

From within the service container, use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it <service-container-name> curl ifconfig.me
```
The output should match the VPN IP, indicating that the service routes traffic through the VPN.

#### Common Issues and Solutions

##### Network Connectivity Issues:

* **Issue:** Services cannot connect to the internet.
  * **Solution:** Doublecheck the VPN container configuration. Make sure that the network mode is correctly set in the `docker.compose.yml` file.

###### VPN Container Fails to Start:

* **Issue:** The VPN container doesn't start / keeps restarting.
  * **Solution:** Check the logs for any errors, and check that the configuration files and credentials you provided are correct. Make sure that the required ports are not bloced by a firewall.

###### Services Not Routing Through the VPN:

* **Issue:** Services bypass the VPN and use the host network.
  * **Solution**: Verify the `network_mode: service:vpn` setting in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Verify that the dependent services start after the VPN container.

##### Tips for Troubleshooting

###### Useful Commands and Logs to Check:

* **View Container Logs:**

Check the logs for both the VPN container, as well as the created services for any error messages.

```bash
docker logs <container-name>
```

* **Inspect Network Settings:**

Verify that the network settings of your containers are properly configured.

```bash
docker network inspect <network-name>
```

* **Check IP Routes:**

Verify the IP routing tables within the containers to ensure that traffic is being routed through the VPN.

```bash
docker exec -it <container-name> ip route
```
